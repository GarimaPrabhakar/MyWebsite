	<!-- Introductory text -->
			<p class="p2"> From the beginning, I've been obsessed with the idea of a world where humans and the environment can
			live in a symbiotic relationship.
			I was lucky enough to be a part of the process that makes it happen. 
			I volunteer at <a class="link" href="http://www.massaudubon.com">Mass Audubon</a>, a 
			statewide non-profit wildlife sanctuary.   </p>

		<p class="classtitles-light">For much of freshman and sophomore year, I have volunteered at Mass Audubon's
		Worcester sanctuary, Broad Meadow Brook. My friend and I were introduced to the volunteering 
		experience at Mass Audubon over the summer. Since then, I spend much of my Saturday volunteering
		at Broad Meadow Brook as receptionist, and 
		also help out in Mass Audubon's biggest events and fundraisers, including the Butterfly festival (image on left). </p>

		<p class="classtitles-light"> One of my favorite events at Mass Audubon was a gathering of several green 
		energy and space-related non-profits, including the prestigious Aldrich Astronomical Society, 
		to celebrate Robert Goddard's launch of his first liquid-fuel rocket in Auburn MA (image on right).
		Being somewhat of a space nerd, I was extremely excited to see the event. 
		I was even fortunate enough to meet the president of the Aldrich Astronomical Society, Jim Zebrowski.
