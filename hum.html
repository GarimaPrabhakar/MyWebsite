<p class="p2">This humanities class is about the most unorthodox humanities class you’ll take in High School. 
I also believe that it is the most engaging, inspiring, and in general, awesome English class I’ve had in my entire life. 
This year, we’re combining psychology, history, sociology, and literature into one year-long study into the question: 
“Who Am I?”. Right now, we’re in particular focusing on social hierarchies and tackling the difficult yet crucial 
problem of stereotype threat. </p>

		<p class="classtitles-light"> We started off the year with a historical overview of 
		ancient cultures and the way their civilizations worked, so that we could better understand how our own 
		civiization works. It was a really intersting project-- so many of the projects that people
		presented were very interesting and engaging. Below is our presentation on the Shang Dynasty<br><br><br>

<h2 class="classtitles-light" style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Humanities Satirical Essay</h2>
<p class="classtitles-light"> While we were studying our central question, we also stumbled upon a variety of persuasion techniques 
the media and the literature uses to convince people of their argument. Below is an essay that I wrote on the effectiveness of the 
rhetorical tool satire. I analyzed the three satires “Fist Bump: The Politics of Fear” by Barry Blitt, 
“So Are We Just Not Going to Tell People New Year’s Was a Month Ago” by Nicole Mullen, and “Have They Run out of Provinces Yet?” 
by Calvin Trillin in comparison to the epitome of satire, “A Modest Proposal” by Jonathan Swift for effectiveness of persuasion.
